A photo show of my cross country trip. Built using Leaflet.

![Whole Route](http://curran.github.io/images/crossCountry/WholeRoute.png)
This is what the program looks like when you [run it](http://curran.github.io/crossCountry/). Images are loaded from Flickr one at a time and placed along the route.
![Zoomed](http://curran.github.io/images/crossCountry/Zoomed.png)
You can zoom in to see images in full resolution.
